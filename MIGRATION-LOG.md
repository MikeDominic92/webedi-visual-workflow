**Stage 2: Response Generation**
- **Before**: `mixtral-8x7b-32768` (Kimi K2 on Groq)
- **After**: `anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku:beta` (via OpenRouter)
- **Rationale**: Higher quality responses, better technical solution generation

**Fallback Models**
- **Parser Fallback**: `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`
- **Generator Fallback**: `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- **Rationale**: Redundancy and cost optimization

### Architecture Changes

**API Integration**
- **Before**: Separate SDKs for Google AI and Groq
