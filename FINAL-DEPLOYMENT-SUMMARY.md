## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully transformed the WebEDI Visual Workflow application from separate Gemini/Groq integrations to a **unified OpenRouter architecture** with the requested AI model configuration:

### 🤖 Final AI Model Configuration
- **Stage 1**: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` - Advanced reasoning and ticket parsing
- **Stage 2**: `moonshot/kimi-k2-0711-preview` - Ultra-fast response generation with Kimi K2

### 🔧 Technical Achievements

1. **✅ OpenRouter Integration Complete**
   - Unified API key management through OpenRouter
   - Single configuration point for all AI models
   - Cost optimization with free tier models where available

2. **✅ 2-Stage AI Workflow Implemented**
   - Stage 1: Gemini 2.0 Flash for context processing and parsing
   - Stage 2: Kimi K2 for fast response generation (185+ tokens/sec)
   - Robust fallback to regex parsing if AI fails

3. **✅ Production Deployment**
   - Successfully built and deployed to Netlify
   - Environment variables properly configured
   - Application fully functional with sample tickets

4. **✅ GitHub Repository Updated**
   - All changes committed and pushed to master branch
   - Comprehensive documentation updated
   - Migration logs and project showcase created
